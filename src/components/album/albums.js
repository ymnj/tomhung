		intro: `Home away from home. Whenever I have the opportunity to travel, Taiwan is always at the top of the list. After graduating university back in 2010, I ended up travelling for half a year between Korea and Taiwan. Despite having
						immigrated from the country when I was six, the feeling of familiarity never went away. It's a constant reminder of how little things change when I can recognize the same people, stores and alleyways that have essentially stayed the same for over 20 years.`

		intro: `A short road trip to the edge of Canada's west coast. The trip started early around 3 a.m in order to catch the ferry ride over to Vancouver Island. It's a trip I've made countless times since I studied at the University of Victoria, but instead of landing in Swartz Bay, we headed towards Nanaimo. Once we arrived, it was another 3 hour drive before reaching Tofino.`

		intro: `Stanley Park is one of the city's favorite attractions, particularly for tourists. Although its many unforgettable experiences may be lost on long time residents of Vancouver, biking along the seawall is an activity my friends and I always do in the summer. `

		intro: `A great place to take someone if you want to show them why our license plates contain the phrase "Beautiful British Columbia. The Sea to Summit hiking trail is a 7.5km hike up that took us roughly 4-5 hours to reach the top. As someone with poor conditioning and lack of cardio, some of the steeper sections were not painless to say the least. However, reaching the top was definitely worth the trip as the scenary is something unique you won't find elsewhere. For those that would rather not hike up to the summit, there is an option of taking the gondola both ways."`
